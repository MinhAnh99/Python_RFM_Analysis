# Python_RFM_Analysis

## I. Introduction
### Exploring RFM
- RFM helps businesses by finding the most profitable customers and segmenting them based on their rankings for the purpose to generate more successful and personalized marketing efforts while minimizing overall spending.
- RFM analysis is a marketing technique used to quantitatively rank and group customers based on the recency, frequency and monetary total of their recent transactions to identify the best customers and perform targeted marketing campaigns:
  - ***Recency***: How recent was the customer's last purchase?
  - ***Frequency***: How often did this customer make a purchase in a given period?
  - ***Monetary***: How much money did the customer spend in a given period?

### Business case study in this project
- SuperStore Company is a worldwide retailer. The Marketing Department plans to do advertising campaigns during Christmas and New Year's to say thanks to customers for their support over the last year. In addition, potential customers can be attracted to become loyal customers.
- The Marketing Department asked the Data Analytics Department to assist in implementing a classification problem and also proposed a plan to use the RFM model in Python to segment customers to deploy a marketing program suitable for each customer group.

## III. Insights

### Recency, Frequency and Monetary value of Superstore:
- There are not many good signals in Superstore's Recency and Frequency. As a result of the high rate of clients buying once and twice, SuperStore Company needs to pay close attention to F,R.
- Few consumers make purchases that last for 7 times or more purchases. The median frequency for a retail company is six times, which is low. It means that customer loyalty is low.
- The most revenue and profit comes from "New Customers".

- Potential Loyalist (14.29%) and At Risk (12.14%) are the two segments with the highest percentage of customers.
- A significant percentage of customers, 11.38% and 10.49%, respectively, were in bad groups including Hibernating and Lost Customers. less than 8% of revenue comes from these two organizations.
- Less than 17% of the total number of customers are represented by the two segments with the highest ratings: Champions, 8.98%, and Loyal, 7.84%.
- Potential loyalists have the biggest percentage of customers (14.29%), but just 9.02% of revenue. At Risk, the negative segment, accounts for 18.24% of revenue.
## IV. Recommendations
The SuperStore Company should put more effort on improving Recency and Frequency performance.  SuperStore needs to discover strategies to reach out to customers in the At Risk group and focus their efforts on inspiring the Potential Loyalist group to become Loyal and Champions during this Christmas-New Year marketing campaign.
- Send customized emails to customers with valuable information and suggestions regarding the best-selling subcategories, such as binders, paper, furnishings, phones, and storage.
- Launch an exciting new campaign (exchange points, gifts, or vouchers) to get consumers in these groups to join in a survey that will help you determine the primary reason of their long absences.
