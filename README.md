# Python_RFM_Analysis
## I. Introduction
### Exploring RFM
- RFM helps businesses by finding theÂ most profitable customers and segmenting them based on their rankings for the purpose to generate more successful and personalized marketing efforts while minimizing overall spending.
- RFM analysis is a marketing technique used to quantitatively rank and group customers based on the recency, frequency and monetary total of their recent transactions to identify the best customers and perform targeted marketing campaigns:
  - ***Recency***: How recent was the customer's last purchase?
  - ***Frequency***: How often did this customer make a purchase in a given period?
  - ***Monetary***: How much money did the customer spend in a given period?

### Business case study in this project
- SuperStore Company is a worldwide retailer. The Marketing Department plans to do advertising campaigns during Christmas and New Year's to say thanks to customers for their support over the last year. In addition, potential customers can be attracted to become loyal customers.
- The Marketing Department asked the Data Analytics Department to assist in implementing a classification problem and also proposed a plan to use the RFM model in Python to segment customers to deploy a marketing program suitable for each customer group.
